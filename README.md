We were assigned to make an application of our own to meet certain criteria assigned to us, along with using new technology not used in class.

* We decided to use anime.js as a new technology to help out with this project.

* As a group we decided to make a fitness app to help individuals get a generated music playlist depending on their emotions, but also generates a workout depending on est they decide to do.
* The project was broken down between the five members where each was assigned a task depending on what one was most comfortable with. While two individuals worked on the front end, one was mainly focused on the back end, while the last two would jump back in forth from the front end and back end to help.
* When the user is prompted to the cite he is the asked to log in or sign up using his credentials.
* Once logged in he can then choose the mood hes feeling depending how he is feeling whether it is happy, sad, or mad. The user will then be prompetd with a playlist according to his emotions.
* After the user can then select what muscles he is trying to workout and click on the section he wnats where a set of workouts will be prompted for him to do.
* One the individual is doen with the wokrout he can then turn off the music and logout and continue on with his day where he can continue to use the app in the coming days.
